# ageManipulation
This repository contains Python script files that I used during my undergraduate internship at the University of Bologna to perform inference on face aging models using the supercomputers at CINECA. It also includes various Excel files representing the results obtained. The work from the internship was further expanded in my undergraduate thesis.
